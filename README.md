My first repository on GitHub!

Hello World!

My name is Ben and I’m creating the world’s first digital taco. As I’m sure you’re aware, tacos are a fan favorite among developers and the perfect digital food because they can easily be consumed in just a few bytes. :)

I’m also working on a new digital cheeseburger which are a great alternative for those power users out there.

Check back for updates!
